# ProjectC frontend

It makes sense only in context of all project, that i can't share, But here you can look at my code and some components and pages in storybook.

**WARNING! This is not original repository. Commit history does not match the real one!!!**

- Node version: 22.16.0
- npm version: 10.9.2

To see some components run:
- clone repository
- make shure you're using right node version
- run:
```
npm ci
npm run storybook
```

If you want to see all project in action, contact the author of repository.
